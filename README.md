# Sudoku Puzzle Solver

Programming Language: C

As an avid sudoku puzzler, I had always wanted to create a program that could help a human puzzle solver skip over the tedious parts of solving a puzzle by hand by instantly filling the grid with markings and simple deductions. The C language program I created runs on XCode. At this point, the program can solve advanced-level problems that require the use of XWing and YWing solving techniques.

Sudoku Techniques Used:\
Doubles\
Hidden singles\
Hidden doubles\
Singles\
Locked candidate\
Pointing tuple\
X wing\
Y wing

More algorithms, such as "hidden triples," will be added in the future to improve the program's problem-solving capabilities.
